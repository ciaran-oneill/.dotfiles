# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash


Makefile:
Makefile has two targets: linux and clean.

The linux target has a prerequisite on the clean target, meaning that clean must be run first before linux.

The linux target runs the ./bin/linux.sh script, which sets up a Linux environment by creating a .TRASH directory, renaming the .vimrc file (if it exists), copying the etc/vimrc file to ~/.vimrc, and appending source ~/.dotfiles/etc/bashrc_custom to the end of the ~/.bashrc file.
cleanup.sh:
Removes .vimrc, removes a specific line from .bashrc, and removes the .TRASH directory

linux.sh:
Checks to see if the operating system in linux and returns an error if it is not, creates the .TRASH directory (if it doesnâ€™t exist), checks to see if the .vimrc file exists in the home directory, overwrites the contents of etc/vimrc to .vimrc in the home directory, and adds a statement to the end of the .bashrc file
